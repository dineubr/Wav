SoundWave
=========
SoundWave.php is a PHP object to encapsulate a wav file. 

SoundWave.php can read from and write to an 8 or 16 bit wav file. 
Information on the wav specification I found here: 
https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/ 
I also based this work loosely on the python wav utilities.
