Wav
=========
Wav.php is a PHP library for reading and writing to a wav format file. 

Wav.php can read from and write to an 8 or 16 bit wav file. 

This work is based on information on the wav specification I found here: 
https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/ 
I also based this work loosely on the python wav utilities.
